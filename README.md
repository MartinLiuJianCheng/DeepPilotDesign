# Pilot Design for ChannelNet 

This is an implementation of the paper "Pilot pattern design for deep learning based channel estimation in OFDM systems"

# Usage 

The main.py file shows an example of pilot pattern design for a VehA channel with 72 sub-carriers and 14 time slots. 
In this example, first indices are found using Concrete Autoencoder network and then the interpolation and SRCNN networks are trained based on the designed pilot setup.
